# slayschool_writing_web_view

In this take home assessment, I've developed a desktop web user interface using Flutter for the Writing Feature of the SlaySchool App. The key option I added was to hide the results text box to emphasize input text box instead. If the user is on a Desktop, they're likely writing longer content than on mobile, so having an empty text box for the results takes up unnecessary space and attention.

If I had more time, I'd have implemented a dark mode feature, an option to display the buttons as icons if the window is resized small enough, and a simple backend to use the OpenAI API to transform the users input text into paraphrased text.
